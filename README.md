# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Any ideas for what you'd like your final project to be?
      - I iterated over a number of ideas making my best attempt to not repeat or duplicate any ideas provided as examples or related to past projects.  One of my main goals and probably my highest priority was keeping the project as simple as possible while meeting the certification requirements.  My main passion, career, and enjoyment comes from the Smart Contract Auditing and Security Research areas.  The idea I settled on for my project is a smart contract implementation of an "appreciation token/coin", which is representative of a sincere admiration or thanks for a service or help. This concept can also be used as an appreciation of attending a talk or workshop live (whether virtually or on-location, but that is beyond the scope of the project.  This project may seem trivial, but I think the specific application I have chosen could be beneficial and seen as a baseline for more ideas in the future.



What's something that you have been thinking about building a blockchain application for?
      - The idea of the "Coogan Coin" was originally derived of an idea of using the ERC721 standard to represent appreciation for apperciatoin or even more abstract a unique moment in time. For example one could be provided, requested and granted for something as small as a small deposit of Test Eth to that of a One on One Zoom tutoring session during the academy semester.  I concluded on this specific example for both the simplicity and alliteration.  I also believe that I can easily elicit feedback see if there is any personal value in seeing every unique moment in which you have helped someone. (Perhaps not as much value in the short term, but over many years, one persons impact could be incredible)

Explain in a very simple way what you'd like your project to do.
  - I would like my project to be a simple and seamless way for a student/user to collect an NFT which represents the efforts of Coogan in educating and onboarding thousands of people and have it be represented in a way that in the future anyone with one could display or celebrate a person by staking them for incentives or social and community prosperity ....and dedication to the students and reputation of the ConsenSys Academy
  
  
Walk through a single workflow for the future user of your project.
  - 1) Coogan shares link of front-end to student or grateful listener
    2) Front-end simple interface has a "button" to click on
    3) Once the front-end interaction has taken place a limit of one interactions will be placed on each account
    4) After Interaction has taken place a NFT/ unique CooganCoin will be minted
    5) New coin will be sent to the wallet of the user that they used as initial front-end interaction or could be thought of as registration
    6) Disconnect wallet from application and HODL so one day Coogan can see how many people he has escorted into the Web3 ecosystem
  

Isolate two or three essential things a user will do
  - The user will interact with a simple front end button
  - Connect their MetaMask wallet to the back end smart contract
  - Call mint function to produce an NFT as proof of assistance and appreciation
 
  - Send NFT to user who was provided link and interacted with front end (MAX 1x)
